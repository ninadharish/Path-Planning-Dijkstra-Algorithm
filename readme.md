# ENPM661 Project 2 - Path Planning with Dijkstra Algorithm

## Personnel
### Ninad Harishchandrakar


## Running the program

### Generate the Optimal Path in the obstacle course to travel from one point to another found with the Dijkstra Algorithm and visualize it:
#### The Numpy and OpenCV Python libraries are used for this project.

Open the Project folder /proj2_ninad_harish in a Terminal.
```
cd /proj2_ninad_harish
```
Run the following to start the simulation:
```
python project2_dijkstra.py
```
Follow the instructions on screen to input the coordinates of the start and goal points. If they are valid (not inside the clearance space or obstacle), the simulation starts. Wait until the optimal path is found. This will be depcted with blue color.
